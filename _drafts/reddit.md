WIP

## Outline

- We read everything. Everything.
- The ratio of "people who work here" to "people who use our product" is very big. We can't give personalized support to everyone, not even close.
- Most issues are things we're aware of and either actively working on or plan to prioritize, they're just buried under everything else.
- Duolingo-specific aside: human languages are really, really complicated. Look out for an upcoming blog post on this.
- Deploying software that is (a) performant and (b) featureful onto multiple platforms for tens of millions of people is very hard. We can't move as fast as you think we can.
