It is perhaps an ancient meme that anytime someone sets up a blog, the [first][static-blog-1] [thing][static-blog-2] [they][static-blog-3] [do][static-blog-4] is blog about their setup. Far be it from me to play into stereotypes, but given that I'm pretty fond of my current setup, I figured I might as well give into the inevitable. And honestly, I felt like there weren't any good resources out there for what I did, so hopefully some will find this post useful.

## Preliminaries



# TODO/Outline

- what is GitHub Pages?
- What is Jekyll?
- I use Namecheap for my domain, they're pretty good, plenty of guides online
- Setting up Jekyll (copy from Discord thread)
- upgrading the Ubuntu version - shenanigans
	gem install bundler
	bundle update --bundler
	bundle update
	gem update jekyll
	gem update
	jekyll serve
	bundle exec jekyll serve
	bundle add webrick
