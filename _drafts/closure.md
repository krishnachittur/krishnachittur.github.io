The Wikipedia disambiguation page for "closure" has... a lot of entries. I mean, [a lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure) of entries. Of these 60-or-so items, let's pick out two popular ones to focus on for now. While they are quite different, I think looking at the parallels between them can give us a bit more insight into the way people like to visualize the underlying ideas.

First, let's discuss the [topological notion of closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(topology)). Much of the foundations of topology in mathematics are based on the idea of generalizing open intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ to a more general concept called an "open set". (Recall that an open interval $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers $x$ such that $a \lt x \lt b$.)


# Outline/TODO
- topological notion of closure
- programming notion of closure
- links between the two (notion of capturing environment, etc.)
