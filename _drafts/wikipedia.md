Good Wikipedia articles can make for great reading. But _bad_ Wikipedia articles can make for _excellent_ reading.

## My favorite warning: "excessive amount of intricate detail"

TODO https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Gaster 

TODO create blockquote element

TODO "I would never stoop to vandalism, but I'm not above discreetly deleting the occasional 'this article contains excessive amounts of detail' tag." - Randall Munroe, xkcd 2782

## Original research and excessive use of primary sources

TODO

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem
- (random example) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory
- even better when the author is clearly a passerby academic that doesn't care at all about Wikipedia's NPOV or citation style

## Excessive citations

TODO display alt text as captions

![Screenshot of Brexit article from Wikipedia with "excessive citations" complaint attached to a long list of evidence that it's bad for the UK economy.](/assets/images/posts/wikipedia-citations-brexit.png "A good list of citations is like a truncheon: threatening merely by its presence, surely, but best used to whack someone over the head.")

![Screenshot of "Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia" with citations for every single organization caught defacing Wikipedia.](/assets/images/posts/wikipedia-citations-wikiscanner.png "Something tells me that Wikipedians were slightly upset when they discovered their project was defaced.")

![Screenshot of Kris Deltarune wiki page with a million citations for their use of "they/them" pronouns.](/assets/images/posts/wikipedia-citations-kris.png "Are you sure, though? Are you really sure? Maybe we should add a few more citations for clarity?")


## Wrapping up

Wikipedia is mature now, and has long since grown from a small project to one of the pillars of the internet: a towering achievement not for any one person but for humanity in general. But big and professional can also mean cold and sterile. So my favorite parts will always be at the corners and cracks, where the underlying humanity shines through, and where you're reminded once again of just how much of a passion project Wikipedia really is.
