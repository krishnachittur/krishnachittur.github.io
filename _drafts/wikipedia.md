## Outline

- good wikipedia articles are great. bad wikipedia articles can also be great
- my favorite warning: "excessive amount of intricate detail"
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Gaster
    - "I would never stoop to vandalism, but I'm not above discreetly deleting the occasional 'this article contains excessive amounts of detail' tag." - Randall Munroe https://xkcd.com/2782/
- another favorite: original research/excessive use of primary sources
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem
    - (random example) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory
    - even better when the author is clearly a passerby academic that doesn't care at all about Wikipedia's NPOV or citation style
