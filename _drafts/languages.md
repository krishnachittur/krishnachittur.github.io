WIP

## TODO/Outline
- Greek has a word with a comma in it. English also uses both apostrophes and quotes interchangeably, which messes up normalization - refer to funny sequence of language rules (" -> ', ' -> nothing).
- Japanese has 3 different scripts
- Chinese has multiple orthographic systems for the same language
- Korean uses Chinese characters but JUST for names
- han unification is a clusterfuck
- Klingon and German care about casing
- French puts spaces before its punctuation
- Arabic/Yiddish/Hebrew/etc are written right-to-left
- Japanese/Chinese/Thai don't use spaces
- Arabic/Hindi/Bengali use ligatures between characters
- transliterating arbitrary Japanese text into romaji is generally impossible
- Thai has a special alphabet just for Sanskrit loanwords, like Japanese with loanwords in general
- unicode normalization is a huge issue with diacritics but even then you still have problems like multiple accent systems for Greek and omicron looking like "O". Urdu is like Hindi but with an Arabic script, Kazakh is even more nuts with Cyrillic, Latin, and Arabic scripts.
- Indians speaking Hindi with English UI language.
- Thai has separate code points for diacritics which makes tokenization doubly hard.
- The Hawaiian 'okina can be written with five different apostrophes, of which two are correct
