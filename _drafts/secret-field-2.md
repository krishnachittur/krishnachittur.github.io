### Outline
- aside: Busy Beavers and why you can't just describe numbers with English
- 100% of real numbers can't be represented, but we don't mind, why?
	- "order from chaos"
	- we care about order and structure, which arise from our symbols
	- similar analog to how 100% of functions can't be expressed but we don't care
	- Ignoring Solovay-Kitaev theorem, most quantum circuits of interest can be exactly computed (not just approximated) with poly(n) gates
	- this post never really was about just real numbers
